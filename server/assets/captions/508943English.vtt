2
00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:52.886
Listen, Tommaso,

3
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.764
do we really need to fish near the island?

4
00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:57.975
- Eh, you worry too much.
- I don't know.

5
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.102
What if the old stories are true?

6
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.687
Oh, come on, Giacomo.

7
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.939
You really believe in sea monsters?

8
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.859
Too many strange things have
been seen in these waters.

9
00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:08.527
They're all just stories.

10
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.488
Tall tales to keep us away
from a great fishing spot.

11
00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.365
- But, Tommaso...
- We're fine.

12
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.707
Ah, that's more like it.

13
00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.110
What is that?

14
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.179
You missed. Let's go,

15
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.972
before it comes back for us.

16
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.557
I told you they were real.

17
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.018
Oh, what a monster!

18
00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.728
Horrifying!

19
00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.322
Fish out of the barn!
Fish out of the barn!

20
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.115
No, no, no!

21
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.742
Mom's gonna kill me!

22
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:40.536
Caterina!

23
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.871
Wait!

24
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:45.916
Whoa!

25
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.668
Oh, good morning, Mr. Branzino.

26
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.628
And also, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.004
Well, how's Mrs. Branzino?

28
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:52.172
Hi, Luca.

29
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.430
Excuse me, ma'am. Have you...

30
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:01.723
Yes.

31
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.188
Giuseppe, get back here!

32
00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:10.774
You want to run off like
your buddy Enrico?

33
00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:14.319
Because I've got news for you.
He's either dead, or he's

34
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.406
out there. Somewhere. Seeing the world.

35
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.075
But he's probably dead.

36
00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.036
Phew. Okay, that's everyone.

37
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.706
Monalisa, why are you smiling?

38
00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:27.875
Anyone else in there?

39
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.461
Giuseppe.

40
00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:33.589
What did we just talk about?

41
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:36.842
Oh, Giuseppe.

42
00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.595
All right. Let's head out.

43
00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.061
- Hello.
- Good morning.

44
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.940
- Hi, Mrs. Aragosta.
- Hey, Luca!

45
00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.405
- Good morning!
- Morning!

46
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.423
Okay. All clear.

47
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.806
Let me know if you need anything.

48
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:27.226
Anyone?

49
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.978
No? Okay.

50
00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:48.413
Giuseppe...

51
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:10.894
Oh.

52
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:14.606
Huh?

53
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.549
Land monsters! Everybody, under the rock!

54
00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:11.163
Huh?

55
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.457
Luca!

56
00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.876
Lunch is ready!

57
00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:17.294
Be right there!

58
00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.927
Come on! We gotta get back.

59
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:29.848
You're two minutes late.

60
00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:31.099
- Was there a boat? Huh?
- Uh...

61
00:06:31.183 --> 00:06:32.267
- Did you hide?
- Yes, Mom.

62
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:34.853
Because if they catch
even a glimpse of you...

63
00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:36.772
You think they come around
to meet new friends, huh?

64
00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.315
- No.
- Make small talk.

65
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.399
- I... I don't.
- No.

66
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:40.984
- They're here to do murders.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:42.152
So, I'm just making sure you know.

68
00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:43.237
Thanks, Mom.

69
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.321
When I was a kid,

70
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.156
we'd go weeks without seeing a boat,

71
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.200
and let me tell you,
they did not have motors.

72
00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.786
Just a sweaty land monster with a paddle.

73
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.955
- Hi, Grandma. Mwah.
- Hey, Bubble.

74
00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.331
- Hi, Dad.
- Luca!

75
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.501
Look at Pinchy-pessa. She's molting.

76
00:06:57.793 --> 00:06:59.878
Oh, it's magnificent.

77
00:06:59.962 --> 00:07:03.173
Now, here's a champion
show crab if I ever saw one.

78
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.967
- Oh, nice.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

79
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.802
- Don't look her in the eye!
- Sorry.

80
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.013
But don't apologize.
She can sense weakness.

81
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.223
Oh!

82
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.267
Come eat, Luca. Come on.

83
00:07:13.392 --> 00:07:16.103
We better beat those Branzinos
at the crab show this year.

84
00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:19.189
Everyone thinks Bianca Branzino's so great

85
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.774
with her prize-winning crabs

86
00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:23.777
and amazing dolphin impression. Please!

87
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:25.237
Anyone can do that.

88
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:27.656
Right?

89
00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.825
I don't know why dolphins
even sound like that.

90
00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.660
You know, why don't they just talk?

91
00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:32.744
- Luca.
- Huh?

92
00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:34.204
What's on your mind?

93
00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:37.457
Uh... Uh... Well, I was just wondering...

94
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.334
Where do boats come from?

95
00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:43.589
The land monster town.
Just above the surface.

96
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.841
I beat a guy at cards there once.

97
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.718
Mom! What are you doing?

98
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.845
He's old enough to hear about it.

99
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.347
You've been to the surface
and done the change?

100
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.349
No! No! The end! Shut it down!

101
00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.310
I was just curious.

102
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.812
Yeah? Well, the curious fish gets caught.

103
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:01.398
We do not talk, think,
discuss, contemplate,

104
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.067
or go anywhere near the surface! Got it?

105
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:05.319
Yes, Mom.

106
00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.529
Here. Now let's get back to work.

107
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.118
Hey.

108
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.288
Look me in the eye.

109
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.373
You know I love you, right?

110
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:19.708
I know, Mom.

111
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.881
We're a little worried about him, right?

112
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.091
No, thanks! I'm full.

113
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.519
Huh?

114
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.776
Hmm.

115
00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:58.664
Whoa.

116
00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:01.500
Hmm.

117
00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.460
Hmm.

118
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:21.311
<i>Boo.</i>

119
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:22.437
Huh?

120
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:24.690
It's fine. I'm not human.

121
00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.650
Oh! Thank goodness.

122
00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.527
Here, hold this.

123
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:36.243
Uh... Do you live around here?

124
00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:39.079
Down here? No, no, no.
I just came for my stuff.

125
00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.163
Ooh.

126
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.584
Uh, hey! Wait, that's mine!

127
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.841
Sir? You forgot your harpoon and...

128
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.301
Oh, yeah. Thanks!

129
00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.178
What? What are you doing?

130
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.811
No, no!

131
00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:04.813
Ahh! Oh, no!

132
00:10:06.982 --> 00:10:08.108
Help me!

133
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:09.943
First time?

134
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.238
Of course it is! I'm a good kid!

135
00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:14.740
Hey, relax.

136
00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:15.866
Breathe.

137
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:39.723
Whoa.

138
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.726
Well? Isn't it great?

139
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:43.810
No!

140
00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:46.772
It's bad, and I'm not
supposed to be up here.

141
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.148
Good day.

142
00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:55.656
Thank you.

143
00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.910
Good... Good day. Again.

144
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.211
Grandma,

145
00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.296
did you really go up to the...

146
00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:29.940
Okay, everyone. This is, uh, Smuca.

147
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:33.026
Yeah. He's in charge now. Got it?

148
00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:56.758
- Wow.
- Aah!

149
00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:58.260
That was hard to watch.

150
00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.344
Here.

151
00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:00.804
Come on.

152
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:25.913
Whoa.

153
00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:31.543
Wait.

154
00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:33.253
It feels like it's still there.

155
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:34.505
Yeah, that's called phantom tail.

156
00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:35.589
You'll get used to it.

157
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.885
Right. Walking.

158
00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:42.763
Don't worry, you're in luck.
I basically invented it.

159
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.557
To start, stack everything
one on top of the other.

160
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:47.226
Like a pile of rocks.

161
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.231
Great! I mean, fine, whatever.

162
00:12:52.314 --> 00:12:54.441
Now, walking is just like swimming.

163
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:56.401
But without fins. Or a tail.

164
00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:57.611
And also, there's no water.

165
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.404
Otherwise, it's like the exact same thing.

166
00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:00.614
Give it a try.

167
00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:03.825
That's not it. Try it again.

168
00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:07.579
Oh, try to lead with your head.

169
00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:09.248
No, more belly.

170
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.168
That's... That's lying on the ground.

171
00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:14.253
How about this?

172
00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.296
Just take a step without
even thinking about it.

173
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.048
No, no, no, don't think about it.

174
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.050
I don't know how to
not think about something.

175
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.427
Okay, okay. Watch.

176
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:24.471
Point your feet to where
you wanna go. Okay?

177
00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:26.682
And then you just catch yourself

178
00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:27.766
before you fall.

179
00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:31.937
Yeah, that's right.

180
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.482
Heh.

181
00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:39.027
Good. Good.

182
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:41.572
- Yes. Yes!
- I'm... I'm getting it!

183
00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:44.950
Not bad, kid. Alberto Scorfano.

184
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.034
Luca Paguro.

185
00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:51.540
It's a human thing. I'm kind of an expert.

186
00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:53.041
What does it mean?

187
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.627
The thing you just said?

188
00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:57.754
Come on. I'll show you some more stuff!

189
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.091
Mother-of-pearl!

190
00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:02.718
You live up here?

191
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:04.094
Yeah. Me and my dad.

192
00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:05.262
He's not even here a whole lot,

193
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.930
so I pretty much just do whatever I want.

194
00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.140
Isn't it dangerous?

195
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:09.433
Yeah, it's the best!

196
00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.310
Everything good is above the surface.

197
00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:13.520
Like, what else?

198
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:15.230
Air!

199
00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.402
Gravity! Also known as falling!

200
00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:25.699
The sky. Clouds. The sun.

201
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:27.743
Whoa. Don't look at it.

202
00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.536
Just kidding. Definitely look at it.

203
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:33.999
And then, there's human stuff.

204
00:14:37.336 --> 00:14:38.420
Whoa.

205
00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:40.464
As you can see,

206
00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.341
I've been collecting for a long time,

207
00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:43.425
so ask me anything.

208
00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:47.554
Whoa.

209
00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:50.057
Yes. That's the Magic
Singing Lady Machine.

210
00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:52.559
It's broken, unfortunately.

211
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.522
Whoa! You unbroke it!

212
00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.115
What's that?

213
00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:10.202
Oh, it's just the greatest thing
that humans ever made.

214
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.620
The Vespa.

215
00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:13.580
- Whoa.
- You just sit on it,

216
00:15:13.664 --> 00:15:15.541
and it takes you anywhere you wanna go.

217
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:17.334
In the whole stinkin' world!

218
00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.463
"Vespa is freedom."

219
00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:25.300
Huh?

220
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.722
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

221
00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:32.015
Yeah!

222
00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:35.519
Pretty cool, right?

223
00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:38.355
Uh... Yeah.

224
00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.942
Huh. Are you gonna make one?

225
00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.861
I think you have all the parts.

226
00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.363
I do have the parts.

227
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.490
I am gonna make one! You wanna help?

228
00:15:48.574 --> 00:15:52.244
Me? Yeah! Wait! No, I can't.

229
00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.204
- I gotta go home.
- Right this second?

230
00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:56.582
Yeah, if my parents found out
I was up here...

231
00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:58.041
Oof.

232
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.752
It would be bad. So, thank you, but...

233
00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.591
Goodbye. Forever.

234
00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:11.680
Okay, but now, I really do have to go.

235
00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:12.890
Okay. Bye.

236
00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:17.603
Seriously, I have to go,
like, now. Like, right now.

237
00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:18.937
Okay. See ya.

238
00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:23.525
It's even better than the picture.

239
00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:24.610
Yeah, it is.

240
00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:26.945
Gotta run.

241
00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.780
See ya tomorrow!

242
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.246
Luca! Where have you been?

243
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.331
Uh...

244
00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:39.124
<i>Don't say surface.
Don't say surface.</i>

245
00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:40.584
Surface.

246
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.503
What did you just say?

247
00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:43.587
What's wrong with your foot?

248
00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:45.964
<i>Luca.</i>

249
00:16:46.757 --> 00:16:49.259
- Oh, I... I...
- Gonna tell us where you were?

250
00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:51.512
- Uh...
- It's my fault.

251
00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:53.430
I sent him to look for sea cucumbers.

252
00:16:53.514 --> 00:16:56.433
Right! Sorry, Grandma,
I couldn't find them.

253
00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:57.726
Mom, his life is

254
00:16:57.809 --> 00:16:59.895
maybe a little more important
than your snacks.

255
00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:01.939
Thank you.

256
00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:10.864
Whoa! How'd you get it down?

257
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.115
I rode it down.

258
00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.661
- Uh...
- I didn't.

259
00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.913
But I pushed it out the back window.

260
00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.498
Took a while to put back together,

261
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:20.666
but it's fine now.

262
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.626
You ready to ride it?

263
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:29.925
Oh, well, thank you, but no thank you.

264
00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:32.511
I mean, I just think maybe I would die.

265
00:17:32.678 --> 00:17:35.264
Okay, I'll ride it. You hold the ramp.

266
00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:36.348
Uh...

267
00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.394
Sir, maybe we should sleep on it?

268
00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.938
Whatever you do, do not move!

269
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.523
I'm not the guy you want for this.

270
00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:45.649
I'm more of an idea man...

271
00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.776
Take me, gravity!

272
00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:51.989
Um...

273
00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.323
Ouch!

274
00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:55.033
This is normal! Stay focused!

275
00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:00.497
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

276
00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:07.921
He's dead. I killed him!

277
00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:10.090
Whoo-hoo!

278
00:18:10.174 --> 00:18:11.884
- Wait. That was good?
- Oh, my...

279
00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:14.052
Did you see the height I got?

280
00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:15.804
Hey, nice ramping.

281
00:18:15.971 --> 00:18:17.472
Come on, let's build another one.

282
00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.156
Yahoo!

283
00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:37.951
Huh? Huh?

284
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.078
Ow.

285
00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:43.207
Ha-ha!

286
00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:49.379
Whoo-hoo!

287
00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:52.257
Come on, Luca!

288
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.303
Whoa!

289
00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.238
Huh.

290
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.914
What's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

291
00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:28.043
What's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

292
00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:41.390
Look, we gotta ride together.

293
00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:43.267
If you don't sit on the back
and hold on to the front,

294
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.768
the whole thing falls apart.

295
00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:47.271
Oh. And who's holding the ramp?

296
00:19:47.646 --> 00:19:50.107
The turtle. Come on.
He's faster than he looks.

297
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.609
Oh, okay. Here we go.

298
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.737
You, uh, coming?

299
00:19:55.821 --> 00:19:58.198
Nope. I can't do it.
Never in a million years.

300
00:19:58.282 --> 00:20:00.117
Hey, hey, hey. I know your problem.

301
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.451
You've got a Bruno in your head.

302
00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:03.161
- A Bruno?
- Yeah.

303
00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:04.413
I get one, too, sometimes.

304
00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.957
"Alberto, you can't."
"Alberto, you're gonna die."

305
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.876
"Alberto, don't put that in your mouth."

306
00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:12.045
Luca, it's simple.
Don't listen to stupid Bruno.

307
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:14.631
Why is his name Bruno?

308
00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:15.716
I don't care. It doesn't matter.

309
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:16.884
Call him whatever you want.

310
00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:19.386
Shut him up. Say, <i>"Silenzio, Bruno."</i>

311
00:20:22.014 --> 00:20:23.140
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

312
00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.434
Louder! <i>"Silenzio, Bruno!"</i>

313
00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.644
- <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>
- <i>"Silenzio, Bruno!"</i>

314
00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:28.729
<i>Silenzio, Bruno!</i>

315
00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.315
- Can you still hear him?
- Nope! Just you!

316
00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.483
Good! Now, hang on!

317
00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.237
<i>Andiamo!</i>

318
00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.493
Yeah!

319
00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:47.998
<i>Silenzio, Bruno. Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

320
00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.082
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

321
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:50.876
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

322
00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:02.554
- Whoa.
- Wow.

323
00:21:02.638 --> 00:21:03.639
Uh-oh.

324
00:21:12.523 --> 00:21:14.566
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

325
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.528
Yes! We're alive! I can't believe it!

326
00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:19.404
- Take that, Bruno!
- Yes!

327
00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:25.410
What are all those tiny lights?

328
00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:27.913
Anchovies. They go there to sleep.

329
00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:30.874
- Really?
- Yeah.

330
00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.001
And the big fish protects them.

331
00:21:33.085 --> 00:21:34.086
I touched it once.

332
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.129
I don't know, it felt like a fish.

333
00:21:36.213 --> 00:21:37.214
Wow.

334
00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.675
Your life is so much cooler than mine.

335
00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:41.009
I never go anywhere.

336
00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:43.262
I just dream about it.

337
00:21:43.512 --> 00:21:44.680
You came up here.

338
00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:45.931
Thanks to you.

339
00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:49.017
Otherwise, I never would've
seen any of this.

340
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.940
Have you ever gone to the human town?

341
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.024
Yeah!

342
00:21:56.108 --> 00:21:57.526
Uh... No.

343
00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:59.945
But, but my dad told me all about it.

344
00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:01.572
So, I'm pretty much an expert.

345
00:22:02.573 --> 00:22:04.283
Your dad sounds so cool.

346
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.368
You're lucky he lets you do what you want.

347
00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:07.870
Yeah. For sure.

348
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.792
Hey, you remember that time
we almost hit that rock?

349
00:22:13.876 --> 00:22:15.252
And we flew through the air,

350
00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:18.338
and I was like, "Yeah!"
And then you were like, "No!"

351
00:22:20.883 --> 00:22:23.468
Wouldn't it be amazing
to have a real Vespa?

352
00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:26.555
Yeah. That's the dream.

353
00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:28.307
Yeah.

354
00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:35.522
Whoo!

355
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:38.901
Oh, Luca, look!

356
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:41.653
Whoa!

357
00:22:41.737 --> 00:22:43.572
Wild Vespas!

358
00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:45.574
Whoo-hoo!

359
00:22:46.617 --> 00:22:47.910
Luca, take over!

360
00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:51.163
Yeah, man!

361
00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:55.667
Come on, faster!

362
00:22:57.044 --> 00:23:00.047
Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

363
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.508
Whoo-hoo!

364
00:23:10.474 --> 00:23:12.267
Whoa.

365
00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:19.191
I'm doing it, Alberto! I'm doing it!

366
00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:20.817
Alberto?

367
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:30.536
Oh, no! I fell asleep!

368
00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:31.954
What?

369
00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:36.792
Phew.

370
00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:42.756
Uh...

371
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:46.343
Daniela, do we really need
to go through with this?

372
00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:47.553
With what?

373
00:23:47.636 --> 00:23:50.806
Uh, son, you're in big trouble.

374
00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:52.558
You need to promise us

375
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:56.311
that you'll never sneak off
to the surface again.

376
00:23:56.395 --> 00:23:57.980
Uh, I'm really sorry.

377
00:23:58.063 --> 00:24:01.316
But, you know, it's not
that dangerous up there.

378
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.526
Maybe I could show you.

379
00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:05.195
I told you. Our son has a death wish.

380
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.947
But, Mom, we're always careful!

381
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.031
"We"?

382
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:11.577
Me and my friend, Alberto.

383
00:24:11.952 --> 00:24:14.037
But it's okay. He's one of us.

384
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:17.833
Ah, yes. There's usually a bad influence.

385
00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:21.170
Good thing you sent for me
when you did, huh?

386
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.257
Luca, this is my brother, your Uncle Ugo.

387
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.176
Thanks again for coming all this way

388
00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:28.552
on such short notice.

389
00:24:29.428 --> 00:24:30.679
Of course.

390
00:24:30.762 --> 00:24:31.972
Hello, Luca.

391
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:34.600
It's really nice to...

392
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:38.395
Luca, I need you to punch his heart.

393
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.772
That's right. The red thing. Punch it.

394
00:24:40.856 --> 00:24:42.274
- Harder!
- Oh.

395
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:46.820
Thanks for that. Too much oxygen up here.

396
00:24:46.904 --> 00:24:50.532
Not like the deep.
As you'll learn.

397
00:24:51.241 --> 00:24:52.242
What?

398
00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:53.869
Sure, there's no sunlight,

399
00:24:53.952 --> 00:24:56.246
but there's nothing to see anyway.

400
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.083
Or do. It's just you and your thoughts,

401
00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:04.046
and all the whale carcass you can eat.

402
00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:06.965
Little bits of it
just float into your mouth.

403
00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:08.217
You can't stop it.

404
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.719
You can't see it. So if you...

405
00:25:10.802 --> 00:25:13.722
The mouth opened,
the whale carcass go in.

406
00:25:13.889 --> 00:25:16.016
Yes, good. I recommend it.

407
00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:18.519
Come on. No time to waste.

408
00:25:18.602 --> 00:25:20.354
Mom, what does he mean?

409
00:25:20.437 --> 00:25:22.397
You're going to stay with Uncle Ugo

410
00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:23.607
for the rest of the season.

411
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:24.775
No, I can't!

412
00:25:24.858 --> 00:25:27.361
Two seasons, then. Wanna go for three?

413
00:25:27.444 --> 00:25:28.820
Why are you doing this?

414
00:25:28.904 --> 00:25:31.698
The world is a very dangerous place, Luca,

415
00:25:31.782 --> 00:25:34.201
and if I have to send you
to the bottom of the ocean

416
00:25:34.284 --> 00:25:35.911
to keep you safe, so be it.

417
00:25:35.994 --> 00:25:37.287
You don't know what it's like up there!

418
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:40.457
I know you. And I know
what's best for you.

419
00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:42.167
It's done.

420
00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:46.088
Hey. Look me in the eye.

421
00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:48.757
You know I love you, right?

422
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:04.106
They're sending me to the deep!

423
00:26:04.189 --> 00:26:05.816
To live with my weird see-through uncle!

424
00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:07.484
- What do I do?
- Stay?

425
00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:09.361
Up here? They'll come looking for me.

426
00:26:09.444 --> 00:26:10.988
Okay, that may be true,

427
00:26:11.613 --> 00:26:14.908
but will they come
looking for you over there?

428
00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:17.828
No way. That's crazy.

429
00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:20.414
I mean, that place must be full of Vespas.

430
00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:22.416
- There's gotta be one for us.
- Huh.

431
00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:24.084
A real Vespa.

432
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:26.003
Could we even survive over there?

433
00:26:26.086 --> 00:26:28.839
You and me? We can do anything.

434
00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:30.591
We'd swim right over to Vespatown,

435
00:26:30.674 --> 00:26:31.758
track down <i>Signor</i> Vespa,

436
00:26:31.842 --> 00:26:33.969
Wait. Do you really think
there's a <i>Signor</i> Vespa?

437
00:26:34.052 --> 00:26:35.971
- Makes sense, right?
- Yes. Continue.

438
00:26:36.054 --> 00:26:39.975
And we say, <i>"Signor</i> Vespa,
build us one of these!"

439
00:26:40.058 --> 00:26:42.853
Whoa. This is the greatest
drawing I've ever seen.

440
00:26:42.936 --> 00:26:45.731
Yeah, I know. Luca, think about it.

441
00:26:45.981 --> 00:26:47.900
Every day, we'll ride someplace new,

442
00:26:47.983 --> 00:26:50.611
and every night,
we'll sleep under the fish.

443
00:26:50.694 --> 00:26:53.697
No one to tell us what to do.
Just you and me out there.

444
00:26:54.323 --> 00:26:55.324
<i>Free.</i>

445
00:26:55.407 --> 00:26:56.491
Whoo-hoo!

446
00:26:56.575 --> 00:26:58.452
Take me, gravity!

447
00:27:05.125 --> 00:27:06.376
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

448
00:27:07.252 --> 00:27:08.837
Whoo-hoo!

449
00:27:10.047 --> 00:27:11.131
Yeah!

450
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:23.352
Come on!

451
00:27:24.645 --> 00:27:25.771
Ha-ha!

452
00:27:50.087 --> 00:27:51.964
Yeah! Whoo!

453
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.265
Whoa.

454
00:28:03.892 --> 00:28:06.103
<i>Papà,</i> what's that?

455
00:28:08.438 --> 00:28:09.857
How do we get in?

456
00:28:23.203 --> 00:28:24.538
This will be a breeze.

457
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:26.373
- Just don't get wet.
- Uh...

458
00:28:35.215 --> 00:28:37.092
Actually, this town seems
a little crowded.

459
00:28:37.176 --> 00:28:38.844
Hey! <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

460
00:28:39.011 --> 00:28:40.721
What's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

461
00:28:40.804 --> 00:28:41.805
Huh?

462
00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:44.808
- Huh! It worked.
- See?

463
00:28:45.142 --> 00:28:47.186
You just gotta follow my lead.

464
00:29:15.923 --> 00:29:18.133
Classic human town. Pretty cool, right?

465
00:29:18.217 --> 00:29:20.010
Hey, you do it now. Just say the thing.

466
00:29:20.928 --> 00:29:21.929
Mmm.

467
00:29:22.012 --> 00:29:23.597
Madams,

468
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.432
what's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

469
00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:35.234
Maybe I said it wrong?

470
00:29:35.317 --> 00:29:36.568
Mmm. Mmm!

471
00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:40.989
Wow!

472
00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:42.533
Mmm!

473
00:29:51.083 --> 00:29:53.544
Alberto, this is too dangerous.

474
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.087
Let's get out of here.

475
00:29:55.546 --> 00:29:56.588
And go where?

476
00:30:01.677 --> 00:30:02.678
Whoa.

477
00:30:02.761 --> 00:30:03.929
It's <i>Signor</i> Vespa!

478
00:30:06.265 --> 00:30:07.975
<i>Mannaggia!</i> Here we go.

479
00:30:09.184 --> 00:30:11.812
Oh, <i>mamma mia!</i> Please, no more revving.

480
00:30:13.564 --> 00:30:15.065
<i>Ciao! Ciao!</i>

481
00:30:16.692 --> 00:30:18.652
Beep, beep!

482
00:30:18.735 --> 00:30:21.697
Pride of Portorosso coming through!

483
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.282
- <i>Ciao, belle!</i>
- Hmm, blech!

484
00:30:23.365 --> 00:30:24.700
You're making me blush.

485
00:30:26.827 --> 00:30:30.747
And now, who wants to watch me
eat a big sandwich? Hmm?

486
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:33.792
There it is.

487
00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:35.961
That's how we're gonna see the world.

488
00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:37.629
Hey, little help?

489
00:30:40.257 --> 00:30:41.258
- Huh?
- Hmm?

490
00:30:46.513 --> 00:30:48.765
Oh, <i>mamma mia!</i>
Talk to Ercole. Are you hurt?

491
00:30:48.849 --> 00:30:49.850
Well, my head kinda hurts...

492
00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:52.102
Not you, Ciccio! Out of the way!

493
00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:56.064
Oh, <i>piccolina,</i> if there is
so much as a scratch...

494
00:30:57.274 --> 00:30:59.735
Someone got lucky today. Hmm?

495
00:30:59.818 --> 00:31:01.028
Who got lucky?

496
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.657
Mm-hmm. Out-of-towners, eh?

497
00:31:05.741 --> 00:31:07.326
Let me welcome you.

498
00:31:10.162 --> 00:31:11.205
Ciccio?

499
00:31:11.288 --> 00:31:14.458
I am delighted to meet you,
Number One and Number Two.

500
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:16.543
I love your stylish clothes.

501
00:31:16.627 --> 00:31:19.546
Where did you get them?
A dead body?

502
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:20.631
Dead body.

503
00:31:20.714 --> 00:31:21.715
I'm kidding.

504
00:31:21.798 --> 00:31:23.884
Uh... Look, <i>Signor</i> Vespa...

505
00:31:23.967 --> 00:31:26.220
<i>Signor</i> Vespa?

506
00:31:26.303 --> 00:31:27.513
This guy funny, hmm?

507
00:31:27.596 --> 00:31:29.056
I am Ercole Visconti.

508
00:31:29.139 --> 00:31:31.433
Five-time winner of the Portorosso Cup.

509
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.101
The Portorosso what?

510
00:31:33.185 --> 00:31:34.478
The Portorosso Cup!

511
00:31:35.646 --> 00:31:38.315
How do you think
I paid for my beautiful Vespa?

512
00:31:40.484 --> 00:31:41.735
Hey, stop looking.

513
00:31:41.818 --> 00:31:42.819
She's too beautiful for you.

514
00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:45.572
I, uh...

515
00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:47.282
I love it.

516
00:31:47.366 --> 00:31:49.076
The little guy can't even get a word out.

517
00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:52.788
Oof. And he smells like behind
the <i>pescheria.</i>

518
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:54.540
Hey, my friend smells amazing.

519
00:31:54.623 --> 00:31:56.959
Sorry, sorry. I'll make it up to him.

520
00:31:57.042 --> 00:31:58.919
Ciccio, Guido.

521
00:31:59.002 --> 00:32:00.003
What are you doing?

522
00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:01.088
- Luca!
- Alberto!

523
00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:02.297
Ah, just a little bath.

524
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:03.715
- Oh, no, no, no!
- It's funny.

525
00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:05.300
Huh?

526
00:32:06.927 --> 00:32:08.345
- No!
- Huh?

527
00:32:08.428 --> 00:32:10.305
Hey! Ercole, <i>basta!</i>

528
00:32:10.681 --> 00:32:13.767
Oh, look who's here. Spewlia.

529
00:32:13.851 --> 00:32:16.019
Wow.
That's how you're training for the race?

530
00:32:17.187 --> 00:32:18.438
Your reign of terror is

531
00:32:18.522 --> 00:32:20.148
- coming to an end!
- "Coming to an end."

532
00:32:20.232 --> 00:32:21.400
You mean like a year ago?

533
00:32:21.483 --> 00:32:23.068
When you quit in the middle of the race?

534
00:32:23.151 --> 00:32:25.988
Because you couldn't stop
throwing up?

535
00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:28.323
I didn't quit. They made me stop.

536
00:32:28.657 --> 00:32:30.784
I think that is worse. Now, go away.

537
00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:32.244
I'm having fun with my new friends.

538
00:32:32.327 --> 00:32:33.328
They're coming with me.

539
00:32:34.204 --> 00:32:36.999
Hop on. I could use the extra weight.

540
00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:40.711
Fine. Go start a club. For losers!

541
00:32:41.879 --> 00:32:44.506
<i>Maggiore!</i> Another sighting.
In the harbor, this time.

542
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.842
I know. We are setting up a reward.

543
00:32:46.925 --> 00:32:48.927
Someone's gonna win a nice prize.

544
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:50.637
Me! Me! I win the prizes.

545
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:51.722
Ciccio!

546
00:32:51.805 --> 00:32:52.848
Get your daddy's harpoon!

547
00:32:52.931 --> 00:32:54.975
We're gonna catch a sea monster.

548
00:32:55.058 --> 00:32:56.185
<i>Sì!</i>

549
00:32:56.268 --> 00:32:58.437
<i>Sto imbecille</i> thinks he can be a jerk

550
00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.521
'cause he keeps winning the race,

551
00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:01.106
which he shouldn't even
get to do anymore,

552
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.317
'cause he's too old
and too much of a jerk!

553
00:33:04.651 --> 00:33:06.111
You know, we underdogs

554
00:33:06.195 --> 00:33:07.571
have to look out for each other, right?

555
00:33:08.071 --> 00:33:09.114
What's under the dogs?

556
00:33:09.573 --> 00:33:10.574
Underdogs.

557
00:33:10.657 --> 00:33:12.117
You know, kids who are different,

558
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:13.202
dressed weird,

559
00:33:13.285 --> 00:33:15.495
or a little sweatier than average.

560
00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:16.663
Uh...

561
00:33:16.747 --> 00:33:18.332
Too much? Too much.

562
00:33:18.665 --> 00:33:20.709
So, are you in town for the race?

563
00:33:22.211 --> 00:33:23.629
The Portorosso Cup?

564
00:33:25.506 --> 00:33:27.049
Well, good talk.

565
00:33:27.341 --> 00:33:30.552
I gotta deliver these.
Always be training, you know?

566
00:33:31.929 --> 00:33:34.640
We should ask her
about this Portorosso Cup race.

567
00:33:34.723 --> 00:33:37.434
That's how the loud scary human said
he got his Vespa.

568
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.811
Giulia!

569
00:33:39.895 --> 00:33:42.231
Oh!

570
00:33:42.314 --> 00:33:43.482
- Uh, <i>grazie.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>

571
00:33:43.565 --> 00:33:44.691
Hey, uh, Spewlia?

572
00:33:44.775 --> 00:33:46.902
Giulia. My name is Giulia.

573
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:51.365
Okay. When you race in a cup,
what do you get?

574
00:33:52.115 --> 00:33:53.867
<i>Soldi.</i> Prize money.

575
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:55.202
Oh.

576
00:33:55.285 --> 00:33:56.286
Okay.

577
00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.121
- No, no! Keep going!
- What? Why?

578
00:33:58.205 --> 00:33:59.206
Ask her about the prize money!

579
00:33:59.289 --> 00:34:00.332
But that stuff is useless.

580
00:34:00.415 --> 00:34:02.000
- Maybe that becomes a Vespa.
- How does that become...

581
00:34:02.084 --> 00:34:03.293
- Just ask her!
- Fine, fine, fine.

582
00:34:03.794 --> 00:34:05.504
- Hello again.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

583
00:34:05.587 --> 00:34:08.382
Can we turn the money into something else?

584
00:34:08.966 --> 00:34:10.717
- Something like...
- That.

585
00:34:11.885 --> 00:34:14.680
Pfft. No. But it could get you that.

586
00:34:27.943 --> 00:34:29.027
Whoo-hoo!

587
00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:30.612
It's so beautiful.

588
00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:32.030
Yes, we need it.

589
00:34:32.114 --> 00:34:33.824
Great, so we'll just win the race.

590
00:34:35.325 --> 00:34:36.535
You'll have to beat Ercole.

591
00:34:36.702 --> 00:34:38.078
Okay, so we'll beat Ercole.

592
00:34:38.161 --> 00:34:39.454
Huh. Really?

593
00:34:39.538 --> 00:34:41.498
Thinks he'll beat Ercole,
this guy.

594
00:34:41.582 --> 00:34:43.208
First of all, get in line!

595
00:34:43.292 --> 00:34:46.795
Every summer, that jerk
makes my life miserable.

596
00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:49.715
So, no one's taking him down
unless it's me!

597
00:34:50.757 --> 00:34:52.801
Second, this isn't any old race.

598
00:34:52.968 --> 00:34:56.013
It's an epic, grueling,
traditional Italian triathlon.

599
00:34:56.096 --> 00:34:58.932
Swimming, cycling, and eating pasta.

600
00:34:59.183 --> 00:35:00.225
So, you'd need a teammate.

601
00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:02.978
Well, we'll figure it out.
Thanks, human girl.

602
00:35:04.646 --> 00:35:07.316
Hey, hey, wait. Wait, Alberto.

603
00:35:07.816 --> 00:35:09.151
What if we join her team?

604
00:35:09.234 --> 00:35:10.277
<i>Grazie! Arrivederci!</i>

605
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.987
Hmm. Better idea.

606
00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.572
Hey, Spew... Girl!

607
00:35:13.655 --> 00:35:14.740
<i>Santa mozzarella.</i>

608
00:35:14.823 --> 00:35:16.867
Congratulations, you're joining our team.

609
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.827
I race alone.

610
00:35:24.082 --> 00:35:26.460
But we could be under the dogs, too.

611
00:35:26.543 --> 00:35:27.753
Hey, it's okay, Luca.

612
00:35:27.836 --> 00:35:30.214
She'd rather do
the whole race alone again.

613
00:35:30.297 --> 00:35:31.965
Maybe this time
she won't throw up as much.

614
00:35:32.049 --> 00:35:33.467
Uh, hang on.

615
00:35:36.011 --> 00:35:37.971
You wanna be on my team, eh?

616
00:35:38.263 --> 00:35:39.515
Let's see what you got.

617
00:35:45.229 --> 00:35:46.355
All right, try jumping onto it.

618
00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:48.357
No, no, no.

619
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.067
You gotta show it you're the boss!

620
00:35:51.944 --> 00:35:53.487
<i>Santa mozzarella.</i>

621
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:54.863
- Eyes up.
- Huh?

622
00:35:54.947 --> 00:35:57.115
Looking down is what's making you fall.

623
00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:01.036
Whoa.

624
00:36:03.288 --> 00:36:04.665
Whoa. I'm doing it.

625
00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:07.417
So, can we be on the team?

626
00:36:08.836 --> 00:36:09.920
Can you dodge obstacles?

627
00:36:10.003 --> 00:36:11.922
What if an old lady crosses your path?

628
00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.926
Can you withstand
passive-aggressive verbal assaults?

629
00:36:16.009 --> 00:36:17.970
"Nice bike,
Number One and Number Two.

630
00:36:18.053 --> 00:36:19.054
"I was kidding.

631
00:36:19.137 --> 00:36:20.597
"Your bike is a disgrace."

632
00:36:20.973 --> 00:36:22.057
Finally, can you handle

633
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.351
the course's fiendishly difficult terrain?

634
00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:25.811
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

635
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.111
Hmm.

636
00:36:36.363 --> 00:36:37.781
Stop. What about you?

637
00:36:37.865 --> 00:36:38.949
Can you swim at least?

638
00:36:39.032 --> 00:36:42.870
Yeah, I'm amazingly
bad at swimming.

639
00:36:42.953 --> 00:36:45.330
You can't swim,
you can barely ride a bike.

640
00:36:46.874 --> 00:36:48.667
I mean, where are you even from?

641
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.169
We're not telling you our secrets!

642
00:36:50.252 --> 00:36:52.045
- We're runaways.
- Runaways?

643
00:36:52.129 --> 00:36:53.463
I don't know, <i>ragazzi...</i>

644
00:36:54.131 --> 00:36:55.132
Please?

645
00:36:55.424 --> 00:36:57.926
My family was gonna send me
somewhere horrible.

646
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.845
Away from everything I love.

647
00:37:00.012 --> 00:37:02.389
But if we win this race, well,

648
00:37:02.472 --> 00:37:03.849
we can be free.

649
00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:06.977
My life's great. I'm just helping him out.

650
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.187
Hmm.

651
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.730
Just give me one more chance.

652
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.231
No.

653
00:37:11.857 --> 00:37:13.567
You guys want it just as bad as I do.

654
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:14.651
You have the hunger.

655
00:37:14.735 --> 00:37:15.944
That's the most important thing.

656
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:17.446
I'm definitely hungry.

657
00:37:17.529 --> 00:37:20.324
<i>Perfetto!</i> You eat, you bike, and I swim.

658
00:37:20.407 --> 00:37:22.701
Underdogs?

659
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.953
Underdogs.

660
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.623
Now we just need money for the entry fee.

661
00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:29.291
From my dad.

662
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:41.637
All right, just let me do the talking
and act casual.

663
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.180
He doesn't do well with fear.

664
00:37:43.263 --> 00:37:44.723
Hey, <i>Papà!</i> I brought

665
00:37:44.806 --> 00:37:46.183
some friends for dinner.

666
00:37:46.266 --> 00:37:47.851
Is there enough for four?

667
00:37:50.646 --> 00:37:51.813
Whoa.

668
00:37:51.897 --> 00:37:53.649
What's wrong with you, <i>stu...</i>

669
00:38:01.323 --> 00:38:02.908
What do you think he kills with those?

670
00:38:03.867 --> 00:38:06.245
Anything that swims.

671
00:38:06.328 --> 00:38:08.038
<i>Hai visto il giornale</i> today?

672
00:38:08.121 --> 00:38:10.165
That photo is a fake, <i>Papà.</i>

673
00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:14.086
Everyone in Portorosso
pretends to believe in sea monsters.

674
00:38:14.586 --> 00:38:16.505
Huh.

675
00:38:16.588 --> 00:38:18.674
Well, I'm not pretending.

676
00:38:20.676 --> 00:38:21.885
Huh?

677
00:38:32.354 --> 00:38:33.689
Slipped.

678
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.441
Eh.

679
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.902
Phew!

680
00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:42.948
Dinner's ready.

681
00:38:43.365 --> 00:38:44.992
Trenette al pesto.

682
00:39:08.182 --> 00:39:09.266
Mmm!

683
00:39:13.228 --> 00:39:14.229
Uh...

684
00:39:14.897 --> 00:39:15.898
Mmm!

685
00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:18.358
Okay.

686
00:39:19.693 --> 00:39:22.154
Where did you boys say you were from?

687
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:26.575
They're, uh,
classmates. From Genova.

688
00:39:26.658 --> 00:39:28.368
Luca and, uh...

689
00:39:28.452 --> 00:39:30.287
- Alberto.
- Alberto.

690
00:39:30.996 --> 00:39:33.498
And what brings you to Portorosso?

691
00:39:33.582 --> 00:39:34.666
Oh. Uh...

692
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.043
Funny you should ask.

693
00:39:36.126 --> 00:39:37.336
They came for the race.

694
00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:39.087
The race?

695
00:39:39.254 --> 00:39:40.464
Yeah.

696
00:39:40.547 --> 00:39:43.175
Uh, you know what? Don't worry about it.

697
00:39:43.258 --> 00:39:45.135
"Don't worry about it"?

698
00:39:45.511 --> 00:39:47.513
Mm-hmm. Don't worry about it.

699
00:39:47.596 --> 00:39:50.766
Giulietta. A word.

700
00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:54.478
I don't want you doing the race again.

701
00:39:54.561 --> 00:39:55.729
You get so upset.

702
00:39:55.812 --> 00:39:58.273
<i>Papà, per favore,</i> I have a team now.

703
00:39:58.357 --> 00:40:01.360
There's also the entry fee.
Money is tight.

704
00:40:01.443 --> 00:40:03.570
I'll work double shifts at the <i>pescheria.</i>
Whatever you need.

705
00:40:03.654 --> 00:40:05.989
I can't sell what I don't have.

706
00:40:06.073 --> 00:40:08.408
What I need is more fish in my net.

707
00:40:10.786 --> 00:40:12.412
Um, excuse me?

708
00:40:12.496 --> 00:40:13.872
We could help.

709
00:40:13.956 --> 00:40:15.374
You know fish?

710
00:40:15.457 --> 00:40:17.292
Oh, we? We know lots of fish.

711
00:40:17.376 --> 00:40:19.545
- Huh.
- Can this face lose?

712
00:40:21.421 --> 00:40:24.258
You want to work? I'll put you to work.

713
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:25.843
Really?

714
00:40:25.926 --> 00:40:27.636
Oh, <i>grazie, Papà.</i>

715
00:40:30.889 --> 00:40:33.141
Machiavelli! Don't you...

716
00:40:33.225 --> 00:40:35.644
No! Machiavelli!

717
00:40:38.063 --> 00:40:39.773
I'm so sorry about the cat.

718
00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:41.358
I don't know what got into him.

719
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:44.319
It's fine. We're gonna head back to, uh...

720
00:40:44.862 --> 00:40:45.863
Oh!

721
00:40:45.946 --> 00:40:48.574
Do you guys need a place to stay?

722
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.243
Cool.

723
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.829
Oops! Sorry. This is my...

724
00:40:53.912 --> 00:40:54.913
Your hideout.

725
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.666
Huh. Yeah. My hideout.

726
00:40:57.833 --> 00:40:59.751
<i>Buonanotte</i>, boys.

727
00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:01.295
Whoa!

728
00:41:02.588 --> 00:41:05.299
Slipped.
Uh, see you in the morning.

729
00:41:07.342 --> 00:41:08.844
- That was close.
- I know.

730
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:10.762
Like, how big was that dad human?

731
00:41:10.846 --> 00:41:12.347
That guy kills things, for sure.

732
00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:14.266
I thought we were gonna die,
like, a hundred times.

733
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:15.350
Hey, relax.

734
00:41:15.434 --> 00:41:17.186
We're incredible at this humaning stuff.

735
00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:19.146
Yeah. You're right.

736
00:41:19.229 --> 00:41:20.564
Did you see me on the bike?

737
00:41:20.647 --> 00:41:21.773
Giulia said, "Look up,"

738
00:41:21.857 --> 00:41:23.192
and then all of a sudden, I was riding it.

739
00:41:23.275 --> 00:41:24.735
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Our Vespa's gonna be

740
00:41:24.818 --> 00:41:26.570
even better than a bike, though.

741
00:41:26.653 --> 00:41:29.031
Because the moment we get it,
we're outta here.

742
00:41:31.033 --> 00:41:33.660
I can't wait.

743
00:41:50.052 --> 00:41:51.512
How could my mother tell him

744
00:41:51.595 --> 00:41:53.722
about this town of bloodthirsty lunatics?

745
00:41:53.805 --> 00:41:55.891
I still can't believe he would do this.

746
00:41:55.974 --> 00:41:56.975
It's not like him.

747
00:41:57.059 --> 00:41:58.227
Just keep your guard up.

748
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.728
There's gonna be land monsters everywhere.

749
00:42:01.605 --> 00:42:04.566
- Daniela! Ooh! Wait! Ow! Ow!
- No! Not today, land monster!

750
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.151
- It's me!
- Oh!

751
00:42:06.235 --> 00:42:07.736
You scared the scales off of me!

752
00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:09.112
Jeez, you're strong!

753
00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:10.489
I'm sorry, I'm just a little on edge.

754
00:42:10.572 --> 00:42:13.492
No. I needed that. It really woke me up.

755
00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:16.495
Wow! We look horrifying.

756
00:42:16.578 --> 00:42:18.038
Ugh, gross.

757
00:42:18.121 --> 00:42:19.915
Come on. Let's find our son.

758
00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:39.059
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Alberto! Wake up!

759
00:42:39.142 --> 00:42:40.978
What? Ahh! The sky's been leaking!

760
00:42:54.199 --> 00:42:56.076
Hmm. Uh...

761
00:42:56.159 --> 00:42:57.411
Oh. There you are!

762
00:42:57.703 --> 00:42:59.246
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

763
00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:00.455
All right, <i>ragazzi.</i>

764
00:43:00.539 --> 00:43:02.499
You want that entry fee,
you got to earn it.

765
00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:03.584
- Giulietta...
- I'm on it!

766
00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:06.044
- ...you make the deliveries.
- Already makin' 'em! <i>Ciao!</i>

767
00:43:06.128 --> 00:43:08.213
Hmm. You two are coming with me.

768
00:43:08.297 --> 00:43:09.298
Oh.

769
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:11.175
Which knife do I get? Huh? Huh?

770
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:12.551
You don't.

771
00:43:14.344 --> 00:43:15.721
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Massimo!

772
00:43:15.804 --> 00:43:18.390
You'll keep an eye out
for those sea monsters, right?

773
00:43:18.473 --> 00:43:19.850
We're all counting on you.

774
00:43:19.933 --> 00:43:22.978
Don't worry, Tommaso.
I've got my eyes peeled.

775
00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:24.479
They won't get away.

776
00:43:33.822 --> 00:43:35.866
Hey, this isn't a joyride.

777
00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:37.367
Make yourselves useful.

778
00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:45.626
Uh...

779
00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:52.674
Hey,
no goofing around back there.

780
00:44:14.863 --> 00:44:16.490
A sea monster ate it.

781
00:44:16.865 --> 00:44:17.991
Huh? What?

782
00:44:18.492 --> 00:44:22.496
<i>Ma, no.</i>
This is how I came into the world.

783
00:44:27.876 --> 00:44:28.877
Whoa.

784
00:44:28.961 --> 00:44:31.630
<i>Mannaggia,</i> not a great catch today.

785
00:44:31.713 --> 00:44:35.175
It might be because we're
over a haunted fish graveyard.

786
00:44:35.259 --> 00:44:38.136
We know it's not haunted.
The fish think it's haunted.

787
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.890
This time of day, most fish
will be right about there.

788
00:44:43.183 --> 00:44:44.309
Hmm.

789
00:44:46.103 --> 00:44:47.563
- <i>Ciao,</i> Giulia.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

790
00:44:49.982 --> 00:44:51.149
Ha-ha!

791
00:44:51.233 --> 00:44:52.526
New personal best!

792
00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:54.987
<i>Santo pecorino.</i>

793
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.280
Shoo! Shoo!

794
00:44:58.407 --> 00:45:00.868
Your friends do know fish.

795
00:45:01.118 --> 00:45:04.079
<i>Benissimo!</i>
Ooh, let's go sign up.

796
00:45:10.836 --> 00:45:11.879
Okay. Okay.

797
00:45:11.962 --> 00:45:13.797
Now, what's our plan? Think, Daniela.

798
00:45:13.881 --> 00:45:15.841
Hey, everything's always on you.

799
00:45:15.924 --> 00:45:17.176
I wanna step up.

800
00:45:17.259 --> 00:45:20.971
- Uh... You sure?
- Oh, yeah. I got this.

801
00:45:22.848 --> 00:45:25.184
Oh, hello there, young man.

802
00:45:25.267 --> 00:45:27.186
- You're not fooling anyone.
- Lorenzo, eh-eh.

803
00:45:27.269 --> 00:45:29.313
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

804
00:45:29.396 --> 00:45:31.523
- Renzo...
- You thought we wouldn't find you?

805
00:45:31.607 --> 00:45:32.858
- Well, guess what?
- I don't think...

806
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:34.776
It's time for us to go home.

807
00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:46.371
Let that be a lesson to you!

808
00:45:46.455 --> 00:45:48.624
Go, go, go! Run before
its mother gets here!

809
00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:51.168
It turns out I don't got this.

810
00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:54.338
No, but I do. I'll know my son when I...

811
00:45:57.341 --> 00:45:58.550
...see him.

812
00:45:59.051 --> 00:46:00.260
Ah, sharks.

813
00:46:00.344 --> 00:46:03.096
<i>Grazie, Papà!</i>
Come on, we'd better hurry.

814
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.098
Okay.

815
00:46:07.392 --> 00:46:08.644
Fellow Portorossans!

816
00:46:09.228 --> 00:46:11.730
It is I, Giorgio Giorgioni!

817
00:46:11.897 --> 00:46:16.527
Slayer of sea monsters
and beloved purveyor of pasta!

818
00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.153
Slayer of sea monsters?

819
00:46:18.237 --> 00:46:20.239
Ah, that's just <i>Signora</i> Marsigliese.

820
00:46:20.322 --> 00:46:22.115
She works for the sponsor for the race.

821
00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:24.076
This is gonna take forever.

822
00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:25.744
The finest pasta in Liguria

823
00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:27.871
at a price every family can afford.

824
00:46:27.955 --> 00:46:29.248
Get to the rules!

825
00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:32.209
Enthusiasm. Love to see it.

826
00:46:32.292 --> 00:46:34.002
To win my famous race,

827
00:46:34.086 --> 00:46:36.421
your team must be the first to brave

828
00:46:36.505 --> 00:46:38.215
the treacherous waters of the bay,

829
00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:40.926
devour a mystery bowl
of my delicious pasta,

830
00:46:41.009 --> 00:46:44.555
and ride to the top
of Mount Portorosso and back!

831
00:46:44.638 --> 00:46:46.223
That all sounds pretty hard.

832
00:46:46.306 --> 00:46:49.142
Yeah. Hard to lose. We're going to win.

833
00:46:49.226 --> 00:46:50.310
I love your confidence.

834
00:46:50.394 --> 00:46:52.062
But don't forget, we're going
to have to go through...

835
00:46:52.145 --> 00:46:53.522
Champion coming through.

836
00:46:53.605 --> 00:46:55.232
- Ugh.
- <i>Ciao, ciao!</i> Hey!

837
00:46:55.315 --> 00:46:56.316
Ercole.

838
00:46:56.817 --> 00:46:58.652
Aren't you a little old, Ercole?

839
00:46:58.735 --> 00:47:00.445
<i>Signora!</i> I am 16.

840
00:47:00.529 --> 00:47:01.947
You said that last year.

841
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.407
But this year, it's true.

842
00:47:03.824 --> 00:47:05.951
You might want to
save your money, <i>ragazzi.</i>

843
00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:08.120
This year, Ercole's gonna
break the record

844
00:47:08.203 --> 00:47:09.997
and make it six in a row.

845
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.541
Oh, no. I don't believe it.

846
00:47:12.624 --> 00:47:15.210
Spewlia, you teamed up
with these vagrants?

847
00:47:15.294 --> 00:47:16.461
Ignore him.

848
00:47:16.545 --> 00:47:17.838
Oh, I wish for you that you could.

849
00:47:17.921 --> 00:47:20.340
I'm afraid your friends still need to pay

850
00:47:20.424 --> 00:47:22.009
the out-of-town weirdo tax.

851
00:47:24.052 --> 00:47:26.221
Hey! Ercole!
You have to give it back!

852
00:47:26.305 --> 00:47:27.973
Ercole doesn't have to do anything.

853
00:47:28.056 --> 00:47:29.808
He's the Portorosso Cup champion,
number one.

854
00:47:29.892 --> 00:47:30.893
And number two,

855
00:47:30.976 --> 00:47:32.436
his life is amazing
and everyone loves him.

856
00:47:32.519 --> 00:47:34.938
They don't love you.
They're afraid of you.

857
00:47:35.022 --> 00:47:37.024
Raise your hand
if you love me.

858
00:47:37.274 --> 00:47:38.734
See? Everyone.

859
00:47:38.817 --> 00:47:40.402
Even you. Bop!

860
00:47:40.485 --> 00:47:42.070
Oh, that's it. Come on, Luca.

861
00:47:42.154 --> 00:47:44.031
Hey! The vagrants want to fight.

862
00:47:44.114 --> 00:47:45.115
Wow!

863
00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:46.867
- Alberto?
- <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

864
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:48.619
Remember, this is for our Vespa.

865
00:47:48.702 --> 00:47:49.995
- Stop.
- A Vespa?

866
00:47:51.163 --> 00:47:52.748
Trash like you can't ride Vespas.

867
00:47:52.831 --> 00:47:56.168
Ercole, you're just afraid
we're gonna put an end to your

868
00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:58.003
- evil empire of injustice.
- "Evil empire of injustice."

869
00:47:58.086 --> 00:47:59.546
Got anything new?

870
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:02.966
Yeah. Here's a new one.
You look like a, uh... Uh...

871
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.968
- A catfish.
- A catfish!

872
00:48:05.052 --> 00:48:06.428
Huh?

873
00:48:07.596 --> 00:48:08.597
Uh, they're bottom-feeders,

874
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.349
and they also have
two sad little whiskers.

875
00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:13.685
Shut up!

876
00:48:16.188 --> 00:48:17.689
Listen, <i>piccoletto,</i>

877
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.651
I eat kids like you for breakfast.

878
00:48:20.734 --> 00:48:23.654
I dunk them in my <i>cioccolata</i> and...

879
00:48:23.737 --> 00:48:25.280
<i>...finiti!</i>

880
00:48:27.157 --> 00:48:29.076
So, here, sign up. Mm?

881
00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:31.703
I'll make it my mission to destroy you.

882
00:48:31.787 --> 00:48:34.957
It's gonna be some race, huh?

883
00:48:35.415 --> 00:48:37.960
Sorry, no autographs today.

884
00:48:38.043 --> 00:48:39.628
You can put your hand down.

885
00:48:40.462 --> 00:48:43.924
Ha-ha! Luca! Bravo, we did it!

886
00:48:46.468 --> 00:48:47.511
Giulia Marcovaldo.

887
00:48:47.594 --> 00:48:49.429
<i>Ciao,</i> Giulia. Team of one?

888
00:48:49.513 --> 00:48:50.764
Not today.

889
00:48:50.931 --> 00:48:53.475
- Luca Paguro.
- Alberto Scorfano.

890
00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:56.645 line:5%
Okay, <i>ragazzi,</i>
we have one week to train.

891
00:48:59.022 --> 00:49:00.065
I got this.

892
00:49:00.399 --> 00:49:01.441
Wait, what?

893
00:49:01.525 --> 00:49:03.110
Every year they change the pasta.

894
00:49:03.193 --> 00:49:04.820
You have to be ready for anything.

895
00:49:04.903 --> 00:49:09.116
Could be cannelloni, penne,
fusilli, trofie, even lasagne.

896
00:49:10.033 --> 00:49:13.245
And you have to use a <i>forchetta.</i>
It's the rule.

897
00:49:13.328 --> 00:49:16.790
Ugh! Rules are for rule people.

898
00:49:27.968 --> 00:49:30.429
Holy carp. No. I can't.

899
00:49:30.512 --> 00:49:32.264
I know, I know.

900
00:49:32.973 --> 00:49:35.100
And remember, <i>piccoletto...</i>

901
00:49:37.102 --> 00:49:40.480
<i>Forza,</i> Luca, don't let him get
in your head. You can do this.

902
00:49:40.564 --> 00:49:43.859
Okay. <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i> Here we go.

903
00:49:43.942 --> 00:49:46.195
I can't!

904
00:49:54.745 --> 00:49:56.830
I guess that's how humans swim?

905
00:49:56.914 --> 00:49:58.498
Ugh, that's embarrassing.

906
00:49:59.458 --> 00:50:00.584
Any sea monsters?

907
00:50:00.667 --> 00:50:04.087
No. But I see some bait.

908
00:50:06.632 --> 00:50:08.759
Oh, no! It's Ercole! Go, go!

909
00:50:09.426 --> 00:50:11.261
- Luca! Faster, faster!
- Why aren't we moving?

910
00:50:11.845 --> 00:50:13.222
Ercole?

911
00:50:18.018 --> 00:50:19.186
- Guido!
- I... I slipped.

912
00:50:19.269 --> 00:50:20.521
Ciccio, slap Guido.

913
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:22.022
Again. Like you mean it.

914
00:50:25.484 --> 00:50:26.777
Huh?

915
00:50:27.778 --> 00:50:29.446
Hmm. Where did the other one go?

916
00:50:31.657 --> 00:50:33.325
- Eh?
- Ercole!

917
00:50:33.408 --> 00:50:35.494
Whoa!

918
00:50:36.662 --> 00:50:39.665
Giulia! It is wool. It cannot get wet!

919
00:50:39.748 --> 00:50:41.750
Ciccio, make it dry, <i>subito!</i>

920
00:50:41.834 --> 00:50:44.002
Luca? Alberto?

921
00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:45.462
Are you okay?

922
00:50:45.546 --> 00:50:46.964
- Um...
- We're good! Good, good, good.

923
00:50:47.047 --> 00:50:49.091
Well, I think that's
enough training for today.

924
00:50:49.174 --> 00:50:50.592
- Yeah. Agreed.
- Yup.

925
00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:54.930
Ah, Ciccio! The motor!
They are slowly getting away!

926
00:50:56.098 --> 00:50:57.307
Guido, slap Ciccio.

927
00:50:58.475 --> 00:51:00.018
With contempt!

928
00:51:01.645 --> 00:51:03.105
- Huh?
- Hmm.

929
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.236
Hey!

930
00:51:09.319 --> 00:51:10.320
Kick it.

931
00:51:13.115 --> 00:51:14.116
Oh!

932
00:51:15.576 --> 00:51:16.869
I have an idea.

933
00:51:16.952 --> 00:51:17.953
Uh-uh. Honey?

934
00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:19.872
Hey, guys! Can I play, too?

935
00:51:19.955 --> 00:51:20.956
Oops, sorry!

936
00:51:21.039 --> 00:51:22.082
I'm not used to legs.

937
00:51:22.165 --> 00:51:23.584
Oh. Okay.

938
00:51:24.751 --> 00:51:25.836
Get the ball!

939
00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:26.920
Come and get it!

940
00:51:27.838 --> 00:51:29.131
Uh-uh!

941
00:51:30.007 --> 00:51:31.592
Not our kid, not our kid.

942
00:51:42.561 --> 00:51:44.021
Ha-ha!

943
00:51:47.816 --> 00:51:50.694
Let's see Bianca Branzino do that!

944
00:51:51.945 --> 00:51:52.946
Good effort, team.

945
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.031
You've earned your pasta tonight.

946
00:51:54.114 --> 00:51:55.115
Can I please eat with my hands?

947
00:51:55.199 --> 00:51:56.200
Where could he be?

948
00:51:56.283 --> 00:51:58.285
Well, at least you won. I think.

949
00:51:58.368 --> 00:51:59.995
Yeah, I guess I did.

950
00:52:00.078 --> 00:52:01.872
Come on. We just gotta keep looking.

951
00:52:07.503 --> 00:52:08.587
Uh...

952
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.673
Alberto? I think
I might've seen my parents.

953
00:52:11.757 --> 00:52:14.009
No way. I told you,
they're not coming here.

954
00:52:14.092 --> 00:52:15.427
But what if they did?

955
00:52:15.511 --> 00:52:16.720
They're gonna send me to the deep.

956
00:52:16.803 --> 00:52:18.680
Listen, relax. It's never gonna happen.

957
00:52:18.764 --> 00:52:19.765
All right, boys.

958
00:52:19.848 --> 00:52:22.017
Pretty good today,
but let's talk technique.

959
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.811
Hey, <i>ragazzi!</i> I need some help
with the nets.

960
00:52:24.895 --> 00:52:27.272
You. The big, strong one.

961
00:52:27.356 --> 00:52:28.649
- <i>Andiamo.</i>
- I'll be right back.

962
00:52:33.987 --> 00:52:35.447
Hey, we're gonna win.

963
00:52:35.614 --> 00:52:37.491
And you'll get your Vespa.

964
00:52:37.908 --> 00:52:39.618
Why do you want a Vespa, again?

965
00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:41.537
Oh. Because it'll be amazing.

966
00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.498
Every day, me and Alberto
are gonna ride someplace new.

967
00:52:44.581 --> 00:52:47.125
And every night,
we'll sleep under the fish.

968
00:52:47.209 --> 00:52:50.170
The fish? Good.

969
00:52:50.254 --> 00:52:52.589
How about you?
What'll you do when you win?

970
00:52:52.673 --> 00:52:54.883
I'll get up
in front of everyone

971
00:52:54.967 --> 00:52:56.969
and say, "Told you I'd win!"

972
00:52:57.052 --> 00:52:58.303
Yeah.

973
00:52:58.679 --> 00:52:59.888
And then what?

974
00:53:00.055 --> 00:53:01.473
Well, that's it.

975
00:53:01.557 --> 00:53:02.766
Look, during school,

976
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:04.726
I live with my <i>mamma</i> in Genova.

977
00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:06.603
And every summer, I come here,

978
00:53:06.687 --> 00:53:09.273
and everyone thinks
I'm just some weird kid

979
00:53:09.356 --> 00:53:10.899
who doesn't belong.

980
00:53:12.484 --> 00:53:13.819
I think I know how you feel.

981
00:53:13.902 --> 00:53:15.821
Right? That's why we gotta win.

982
00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:17.239
The town will cheer our names.

983
00:53:17.656 --> 00:53:20.367
Ercole's life will be ruined!

984
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:21.702
Sorry. Too much?

985
00:53:21.785 --> 00:53:23.787
My mom says sometimes I'm too much.

986
00:53:23.871 --> 00:53:25.664
No way. Not for me.

987
00:53:27.249 --> 00:53:29.793
You know those aren't fish, right?

988
00:53:29.877 --> 00:53:33.046
Of course they are.
Alberto told me all about it.

989
00:53:33.547 --> 00:53:34.548
Come with me.

990
00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.447
This is a telescope.

991
00:53:58.614 --> 00:54:00.616
Old man Bernardi lets me use it.

992
00:54:00.699 --> 00:54:03.869
It makes faraway things seem close. Look.

993
00:54:07.748 --> 00:54:09.333
See any fish?

994
00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:10.876
Then what are all those?

995
00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:12.669
Stars. Like the sun.

996
00:54:12.753 --> 00:54:14.922
Giant, raging balls of fire!

997
00:54:15.088 --> 00:54:17.007
So, Alberto was wrong.

998
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.092
And stars are circled by planets.

999
00:54:22.638 --> 00:54:23.639
Look.

1000
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.517
That's <i>Saturno.</i> It's my favorite.

1001
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.435
It's the lightest of the planets.

1002
00:54:28.519 --> 00:54:31.438
They say if there was an ocean
big enough to hold it,

1003
00:54:31.522 --> 00:54:32.731
it would float in it!

1004
00:54:32.814 --> 00:54:34.024
Whoa!

1005
00:54:36.276 --> 00:54:37.277
Wow!

1006
00:54:42.658 --> 00:54:44.034
Come on, Luca!

1007
00:55:11.436 --> 00:55:12.521 line:5%
So, this is how machines fly?

1008
00:55:12.604 --> 00:55:13.605 line:5%
<i>Sì.</i>

1009
00:55:13.689 --> 00:55:15.232 line:5%
And there are big towns
called cities?

1010
00:55:15.315 --> 00:55:16.316 line:5%
<i>Sì.</i>

1011
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.609
Like even bigger than Portorosso?

1012
00:55:17.693 --> 00:55:19.862
Like Genova! Literally 20 times bigger.

1013
00:55:19.945 --> 00:55:21.905
And we're all on a big round rock,

1014
00:55:21.989 --> 00:55:23.282
floating around a star

1015
00:55:23.365 --> 00:55:25.325
in the "solar system"?

1016
00:55:25.409 --> 00:55:26.785
So cool, right?

1017
00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:28.996
And is there anything
beyond the solar system?

1018
00:55:29.079 --> 00:55:31.540
Only a galaxy full of solar systems.

1019
00:55:31.623 --> 00:55:34.168
- Then what?
- A universe full of galaxies!

1020
00:55:34.251 --> 00:55:36.044
And then what?

1021
00:55:36.128 --> 00:55:37.462
And then...

1022
00:55:37.796 --> 00:55:38.839
I don't know.

1023
00:55:38.922 --> 00:55:40.883
But next year in Advanced Astronomy,

1024
00:55:40.966 --> 00:55:42.593
I'm gonna use my school's telescope.

1025
00:55:42.676 --> 00:55:43.844
So, maybe I'll find out.

1026
00:55:44.136 --> 00:55:47.055
That thing's huge.
I wish I could show it to you.

1027
00:55:47.139 --> 00:55:49.725
Just promise you'll tell me
everything you see!

1028
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:51.602
Sorry. Too much?

1029
00:55:51.685 --> 00:55:53.020
Never.

1030
00:55:54.188 --> 00:55:56.106
Hey, Luca, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1031
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:58.400
- Oh, sorry.
- Just come on. Let's go.

1032
00:55:58.567 --> 00:56:01.862
Could I maybe borrow this?
Just for tonight.

1033
00:56:04.156 --> 00:56:05.449
You can have it.

1034
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:08.327
Ha-ha!

1035
00:56:08.994 --> 00:56:11.788
The universe is literally yours!

1036
00:56:11.872 --> 00:56:13.332
Wow. Thank you!

1037
00:56:13.415 --> 00:56:14.458
Luca!

1038
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:15.751
Okay.

1039
00:56:20.714 --> 00:56:21.715
Where are we going?

1040
00:56:21.798 --> 00:56:23.342
Come on.
I got something to show you.

1041
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.095
Hey, you won't believe this.
Those aren't fish.

1042
00:56:27.179 --> 00:56:28.222
- What?
- Yeah.

1043
00:56:28.305 --> 00:56:29.681
Giulia explained it to me.

1044
00:56:29.765 --> 00:56:30.766
They're fires.

1045
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:33.143
But, like, one million times bigger.

1046
00:56:33.227 --> 00:56:34.937
Uh, no, they're not.

1047
00:56:38.065 --> 00:56:41.026
Soon you'll be ours, sweet Vespa.

1048
00:56:41.193 --> 00:56:42.194
Take a look.

1049
00:56:42.277 --> 00:56:44.238
I thought of every
single thing we're gonna need.

1050
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:45.572 line:5%
Also, I added flames.

1051
00:56:46.073 --> 00:56:47.533
That's so cool!

1052
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.536
Oh! And we can bring
a telescope, too!

1053
00:56:50.619 --> 00:56:52.704
Yeah! That shoots lightning!

1054
00:56:52.788 --> 00:56:53.789
No, no, no.

1055
00:56:53.956 --> 00:56:55.457
You look through it.

1056
00:56:55.791 --> 00:56:58.877
Giulia says there's an even
bigger one at her school.

1057
00:56:59.086 --> 00:57:00.963
Wait. What if we visit her there?

1058
00:57:01.046 --> 00:57:02.840
Why would you wanna do that?

1059
00:57:02.923 --> 00:57:04.633
It kinda sounds interesting.

1060
00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:07.344
The whole reason we're getting a Vespa
is to live on our own.

1061
00:57:07.427 --> 00:57:10.013
We don't need school.
We don't need anybody.

1062
00:57:10.097 --> 00:57:12.057
Couldn't we just try it?

1063
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.684
Just for a few days?

1064
00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:16.353
Luca, sea monsters can't go to school.

1065
00:57:16.436 --> 00:57:17.896
What do you think is gonna happen

1066
00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.398
when they see your fish face?

1067
00:57:22.693 --> 00:57:24.570
Hey, look who it is.

1068
00:57:24.653 --> 00:57:26.822
And with no Giulia to hide behind.

1069
00:57:26.905 --> 00:57:28.532
- Come on. Let's go.
- No.

1070
00:57:28.615 --> 00:57:30.534
Something's fishy with you two.

1071
00:57:30.617 --> 00:57:32.202
I mean, besides the smell.

1072
00:57:32.286 --> 00:57:33.495
You're hiding something.

1073
00:57:33.745 --> 00:57:35.664
Is it that we're smarter than you?

1074
00:57:35.747 --> 00:57:37.749
I mean, we're not really hiding that.

1075
00:57:37.833 --> 00:57:39.209
It's just kind of obvious.

1076
00:57:39.293 --> 00:57:41.420
You know, people think I'm a nice guy.

1077
00:57:41.503 --> 00:57:43.005
Always joking around.

1078
00:57:43.088 --> 00:57:45.340
But really, I'm not.

1079
00:57:45.424 --> 00:57:47.467
- Stop!
- Wait your turn, <i>piccoletto.</i>

1080
00:57:47.551 --> 00:57:49.970
I want to make myself very clear.

1081
00:57:50.053 --> 00:57:51.555
This is my town,

1082
00:57:51.638 --> 00:57:52.764
number one...

1083
00:57:52.848 --> 00:57:56.476
...and number two, I don't want you in it.

1084
00:57:56.894 --> 00:57:58.353
I... I said stop!

1085
00:57:58.729 --> 00:58:01.815
Put that down, <i>piccoletto.</i>
You'll hurt yourself.

1086
00:58:01.899 --> 00:58:03.150
Let him go!

1087
00:58:05.319 --> 00:58:08.739
Go. Now. Before I change my mind.

1088
00:58:09.323 --> 00:58:13.035
Nobody wants you here, <i>idioti!</i>
Keep running!

1089
00:58:15.954 --> 00:58:18.540
Why did you make him mad?
We should've left.

1090
00:58:18.624 --> 00:58:20.042
No, no, no. We're fine.

1091
00:58:20.417 --> 00:58:21.919
I had it under control.

1092
00:58:22.085 --> 00:58:25.172
All you gotta do
is follow my lead, remember?

1093
00:58:35.224 --> 00:58:36.725
Rise and shine!

1094
00:58:38.602 --> 00:58:41.063
Go, go! Go, Alberto! Go!

1095
00:58:54.993 --> 00:58:56.703
Nope. Whoa...

1096
00:59:01.792 --> 00:59:03.085
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

1097
00:59:09.508 --> 00:59:11.176
Sea monster!

1098
00:59:13.262 --> 00:59:14.346
Whew.

1099
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:17.099
Oh.

1100
00:59:19.351 --> 00:59:20.352
Wha...

1101
00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:21.520
Ugo?

1102
00:59:27.568 --> 00:59:28.944
Rise and shine!

1103
00:59:29.027 --> 00:59:30.904
Only two days till the race.

1104
00:59:31.196 --> 00:59:32.197
Hmm.

1105
00:59:33.782 --> 00:59:34.992
Espresso.

1106
00:59:40.122 --> 00:59:41.248
Go, Luca!

1107
00:59:41.331 --> 00:59:42.332
Go, go!

1108
00:59:42.583 --> 00:59:44.084
Hey, don't cheer for him!

1109
00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:47.171
Ha-ha! Whoo!

1110
00:59:48.213 --> 00:59:50.215
This is fun!

1111
00:59:50.299 --> 00:59:52.050
Uh...

1112
00:59:52.676 --> 00:59:53.719
Hmm.

1113
00:59:57.097 --> 00:59:58.098
Mm?

1114
01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:02.519
Huh. Hey!

1115
01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:04.313 line:5%
That's amazing!

1116
01:00:05.522 --> 01:00:06.732 line:5%
Oh, wow!

1117
01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:16.533
I don't know, Lorenzo.
Was I too hard on him?

1118
01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:19.953
No. You were just trying
to keep him safe.

1119
01:00:20.245 --> 01:00:21.330
It's my fault.

1120
01:00:21.413 --> 01:00:24.458
I wasn't paying enough attention to him.

1121
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:27.753
But I was the one who tried
to send him away.

1122
01:00:27.836 --> 01:00:29.922
I just never in a million years

1123
01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:31.340
would have thought he'd do this.

1124
01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:32.424
It's like I don't even know...

1125
01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:33.509
You can do it, Luca!

1126
01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:35.719
...who he is!

1127
01:00:35.802 --> 01:00:37.095
Go, go!

1128
01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.430
- Luca!
- Luca!

1129
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:39.973
Luca, stop!

1130
01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:42.309
Luca!

1131
01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:46.313
Where are we going?

1132
01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:47.940
Uh... A shortcut.

1133
01:00:48.023 --> 01:00:50.442
Steeper, rough terrain... I like it.

1134
01:00:50.609 --> 01:00:52.236
Why aren't you training?

1135
01:00:52.402 --> 01:00:54.238
I'm always training.

1136
01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:03.372
Bravo, Luca. That was your fastest yet.

1137
01:01:03.455 --> 01:01:04.915
Ooh, guys, look!

1138
01:01:05.249 --> 01:01:06.708
That's the train to Genova.

1139
01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:08.085
That goes to your school?

1140
01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:09.169
Yeah.

1141
01:01:09.253 --> 01:01:10.879
I was wondering, actually,

1142
01:01:10.963 --> 01:01:13.590
is your school open to everyone?

1143
01:01:13.674 --> 01:01:16.510
Well, it costs a little money,
but I guess.

1144
01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:17.928
Great. Thank you, Giulia,

1145
01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:19.638
for showing us the boring thing

1146
01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:21.265
that takes us to the terrible place.

1147
01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:23.225
Now, can we focus on what matters?

1148
01:01:23.308 --> 01:01:26.103
If we lose this race,
we're not going anywhere.

1149
01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:28.856
<i>Santa mozzarella.</i> The downhill.

1150
01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:29.940
I know it looks scary.

1151
01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:31.024
But here's what you need to know...

1152
01:01:31.108 --> 01:01:32.234
Would you stop bossing him around?

1153
01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:33.318
What is your problem?

1154
01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:35.529
I'm his friend. I know what he needs.

1155
01:01:35.612 --> 01:01:37.197
Oh, yeah?
Well, then, what does he need?

1156
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:39.992
Me. We'll just ride it
like we did on the island. Together.

1157
01:01:40.742 --> 01:01:41.910
- <i>Andiamo.</i>
- No!

1158
01:01:42.369 --> 01:01:43.579
Alberto, stop!

1159
01:01:43.662 --> 01:01:44.997
That's Bruno talking!

1160
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.666
No! I'm pretty sure that's just me!

1161
01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:54.339
- Stop, Alberto!
- Let it go!

1162
01:01:54.423 --> 01:01:55.424
Look out!

1163
01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:04.683
<i>Porca paletta,</i> what was that?

1164
01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:05.767
Huh?

1165
01:02:05.851 --> 01:02:08.437
Bah! Not now, Ciccio! Eyes on the water!

1166
01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.022
- Move, move!
- Okay.

1167
01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:15.944
Oh, no!
Luca! Alberto!

1168
01:02:16.445 --> 01:02:18.113
She'll see us. Come on!

1169
01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:25.120
Look, I was just trying to
show you how to do it right.

1170
01:02:25.204 --> 01:02:26.747
You don't know how to do it right!

1171
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.165
I got us down the hill, didn't I?

1172
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.334
You crashed! Into the sea!

1173
01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:31.502
It's fine.

1174
01:02:31.585 --> 01:02:34.254
Nothing's fine! My parents just saw me!

1175
01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:35.756
Luca, your parents aren't here.

1176
01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.424
You don't know what you're talking about!

1177
01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:39.343
Look, this town is making you crazy.

1178
01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:41.970
We just need to win that Vespa
and get outta here.

1179
01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:44.389
It's not gonna be any different.

1180
01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:46.058
I don't wanna...

1181
01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:50.687
I wanna go to school.

1182
01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:53.232
That again? We can't go to school.

1183
01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:54.691
You're just afraid you can't do it.

1184
01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:56.235
I'm not afraid.

1185
01:02:56.318 --> 01:02:57.569
You're the one who gets afraid.

1186
01:02:57.653 --> 01:02:58.946
Shut up!

1187
01:03:01.448 --> 01:03:02.449
Ow!

1188
01:03:03.784 --> 01:03:05.244
What happens when she sees you?

1189
01:03:05.327 --> 01:03:06.328
When anyone sees you?

1190
01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:07.746
Get off me!

1191
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:09.748
You're alive!

1192
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:16.088
Hey! You're never allowed
on my bike again.

1193
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:17.840
Stick to food, big guy.

1194
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:22.678
Uh, what's going on?

1195
01:03:22.761 --> 01:03:24.054
Nothing. Let's just get back to training.

1196
01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:26.390
Actually, we have something to ask you.

1197
01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:27.599
We were wondering

1198
01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:29.643
if we could come with you to your school?

1199
01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:33.772
<i>Santo pecorino!</i> That's the best idea ever!

1200
01:03:33.856 --> 01:03:36.108
Yes! Of course!

1201
01:03:40.487 --> 01:03:42.406
Uh, Giulia, your school,

1202
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.449
does it take all kinds of people?

1203
01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:47.244
I mean, what if some of them
were not human?

1204
01:03:47.327 --> 01:03:48.412
Alberto...

1205
01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:52.082
What if some were, oh,
I don't know, sea monsters?

1206
01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:53.166
Sea monsters?

1207
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:56.253
I doubt your school would even
accept sea monsters, right?

1208
01:03:57.462 --> 01:03:59.214
Ah, that's a weird joke, Alberto.

1209
01:03:59.298 --> 01:04:01.133
Yeah, I know, it's kinda hard to imagine.

1210
01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:02.384
So, let me just show you!

1211
01:04:02.467 --> 01:04:03.635
No!

1212
01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.430
- Come on.
- Giulia, wait!

1213
01:04:06.513 --> 01:04:08.265
We don't have time to goof around.

1214
01:04:08.348 --> 01:04:10.058
Huh?

1215
01:04:15.564 --> 01:04:16.565
Help!

1216
01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.192
Don't hurt us!

1217
01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:19.902
- See? I knew this would...
- Sea monster!

1218
01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:22.821
Did you hear that? This way.

1219
01:04:22.905 --> 01:04:24.656
Luca?

1220
01:04:27.075 --> 01:04:28.243
Stay back!

1221
01:04:29.203 --> 01:04:31.580
Sea monster! There it is!

1222
01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:37.503
<i>Ragazzi,</i> now!

1223
01:04:37.586 --> 01:04:38.587
No!

1224
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.136
Ah, <i>idioti,</i> you let it get away!

1225
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.221
To the boat!

1226
01:04:47.304 --> 01:04:48.847
We're gonna kill a sea monster!

1227
01:05:03.028 --> 01:05:06.198
Oh, there you are. I made your favorite,

1228
01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:07.741
trenette al pesto.

1229
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:09.785
Where's Alberto?

1230
01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:12.829
Uh, he left, <i>Signor</i> Marcovaldo.

1231
01:05:17.209 --> 01:05:18.752
Do you know where he went?

1232
01:05:18.836 --> 01:05:20.796
No. But I don't think

1233
01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:22.339
he wants anyone looking for him.

1234
01:05:22.714 --> 01:05:25.050
Maybe not. But just in case.

1235
01:05:28.846 --> 01:05:29.888
Okay.

1236
01:05:29.972 --> 01:05:31.181
Well, the two of us can still do the race.

1237
01:05:31.807 --> 01:05:34.226
You'll swim, you'll eat,
you've done both before...

1238
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:35.727
- Luca, I...
- ...and I'll do the ride.

1239
01:05:35.811 --> 01:05:37.229
I mean, that's allowed, right?

1240
01:05:37.312 --> 01:05:38.897
- Luca. Luca?
- It should be fine,

1241
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:40.274
- we're still okay...
- Luca!

1242
01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:46.488
Sleeping under the fish.
Now I get it.

1243
01:05:46.572 --> 01:05:47.614
Uh, I can explain.

1244
01:05:47.698 --> 01:05:50.409
Of all the places
for sea monsters to visit,

1245
01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:51.785
Portorosso?

1246
01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:53.495
Have you seen this town?

1247
01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:55.998
My father hunts sea monsters!

1248
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:58.166
Luca, you have to get out of here.

1249
01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.460
But I thought we were underdogs.

1250
01:06:00.752 --> 01:06:03.297
Do you think I want you to leave?

1251
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.008
This is the happiest I've...

1252
01:06:06.091 --> 01:06:07.968
Look, it's just not worth it.

1253
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.761
You don't understand.

1254
01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:11.555
No, I don't.

1255
01:06:11.638 --> 01:06:14.266
Risking your life for a Vespa?

1256
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.476
My parents were gonna send me away.

1257
01:06:17.895 --> 01:06:20.314
That's why we did all of this.

1258
01:06:23.192 --> 01:06:25.194
But it's over now.

1259
01:06:29.364 --> 01:06:30.949
Goodbye, Giulia.

1260
01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:32.784
I'm sorry.

1261
01:07:14.868 --> 01:07:16.161
Alberto?

1262
01:07:24.837 --> 01:07:26.463
What are you doing here?

1263
01:07:27.172 --> 01:07:28.215
I'm...

1264
01:07:29.174 --> 01:07:30.175
I'm sorry.

1265
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:33.887
I... I never should've done that.

1266
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:35.097
I wish I could take it back.

1267
01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:38.267
Yeah, whatever. You're sorry.
Now, just go away!

1268
01:07:56.952 --> 01:07:57.953
Alberto?

1269
01:07:58.579 --> 01:08:00.622
What are those marks on the wall?

1270
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:04.001
Tell me what they mean.

1271
01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:08.922
I started when my dad left.

1272
01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:14.219
You were living here alone
for that many days?

1273
01:08:16.096 --> 01:08:18.390
I just stopped counting after a while.

1274
01:08:19.224 --> 01:08:21.268
He said I was old enough to be on my own.

1275
01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:25.731
I just thought that...

1276
01:08:27.316 --> 01:08:28.734
...maybe he'd change his mind.

1277
01:08:30.527 --> 01:08:32.029
Honestly, though, I get it.

1278
01:08:32.404 --> 01:08:33.864
He's better off without me.

1279
01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:35.699
You are, too.

1280
01:08:35.782 --> 01:08:36.909
That's not true.

1281
01:08:36.992 --> 01:08:38.076
Yes, it is.

1282
01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.412
You're not like me. You're the good kid.

1283
01:08:40.913 --> 01:08:43.373
And I'm just
the kid that ruins everything.

1284
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:47.503
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i> That's just
the dumb voice in your head.

1285
01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:48.754
You taught me that.

1286
01:08:48.837 --> 01:08:51.006
And getting a Vespa? Seeing the world...

1287
01:08:51.089 --> 01:08:52.674
Just let it go! Okay?

1288
01:08:52.758 --> 01:08:54.551
Look, you and I
should've never been friends

1289
01:08:54.635 --> 01:08:55.636
in the first place.

1290
01:08:56.428 --> 01:08:57.763
Don't say that.

1291
01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:59.431
- Alberto?
- Get outta here!

1292
01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:01.433
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1293
01:09:06.772 --> 01:09:08.607
Okay. I'll go.

1294
01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:10.526
I'll go win the race.

1295
01:09:11.193 --> 01:09:12.611
- What?
- Yeah.

1296
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:16.031
Yeah! And then the Vespa will be ours!

1297
01:09:16.114 --> 01:09:17.908
And we'll ride away together!

1298
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:19.785
Luca, that's crazy.

1299
01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:21.036
Well, maybe I'm crazy.

1300
01:09:21.119 --> 01:09:22.746
Take me, gravity!

1301
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:23.914
Luca!

1302
01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:25.999
Ow.

1303
01:09:26.333 --> 01:09:27.626
What are you doing?

1304
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:30.128
I'm okay. I'll be back tomorrow.

1305
01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:32.130
I'm gonna fix this!

1306
01:09:37.719 --> 01:09:39.763
You want to split up your team?

1307
01:09:39.847 --> 01:09:41.431
Yes. If it's allowed.

1308
01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:43.308
Luca? What are you doing here?

1309
01:09:43.392 --> 01:09:45.185
Don't worry. I'll race on my own.

1310
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:47.646
You can if you want,
but I don't recommend it.

1311
01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:48.814
Thank you!

1312
01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:50.274
But how are you gonna...

1313
01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:52.693
I mean, what happens when the...

1314
01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:54.403
You can't swim!

1315
01:09:54.486 --> 01:09:55.904
Alone again?

1316
01:09:58.615 --> 01:09:59.616
Hmm.

1317
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.701
- Ah, volunteers...
- Huh?

1318
01:10:00.784 --> 01:10:01.785
- ...you're late.
- Huh?

1319
01:10:01.869 --> 01:10:02.870
One cup for each kid.

1320
01:10:02.953 --> 01:10:03.954
Oh!

1321
01:10:04.037 --> 01:10:05.289
- Yeah. One cup per kid.
- Yes.

1322
01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:06.373
- Got it.
- Here.

1323
01:10:06.456 --> 01:10:09.042
For when Giulia, you know, she...

1324
01:10:20.179 --> 01:10:22.890
Ciccio, hold still. <i>Olio d'oliva.</i>

1325
01:10:22.973 --> 01:10:25.017
He will cut through the water
like a knife.

1326
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.186
- Oh! Ah.
- An oily knife.

1327
01:10:27.895 --> 01:10:28.896
Huh?

1328
01:10:28.979 --> 01:10:30.522
Huh?

1329
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.238
This makes me laugh.

1330
01:10:39.489 --> 01:10:41.575
I guess even your terrible friends

1331
01:10:41.658 --> 01:10:42.743
don't want to be friends.

1332
01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:45.662
Luca! This is a very bad idea!

1333
01:10:45.746 --> 01:10:47.247
Hey, vagrant!

1334
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:49.666
Can't afford a proper swimsuit?

1335
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:51.126
<i>Signore e signori,</i>

1336
01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:54.171
the Portorosso Cup is about to begin!

1337
01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:56.715
We know there's been
a few sightings lately,

1338
01:10:56.798 --> 01:10:58.133
but fear not!

1339
01:10:58.217 --> 01:11:00.177
If any sea monsters show up today,

1340
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.762
we are ready for them.

1341
01:11:04.348 --> 01:11:06.683
Swimmers, take your mark!

1342
01:11:46.056 --> 01:11:47.724
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1343
01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.061
What?

1344
01:11:58.735 --> 01:12:00.237
Swim, Ciccio! Come on!

1345
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.114
Swim!

1346
01:12:06.743 --> 01:12:08.370
Ha-ha! Trenette!

1347
01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:28.640
Come on!

1348
01:12:31.602 --> 01:12:33.645
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

1349
01:12:34.813 --> 01:12:37.441
Stop crying and tag Guido! <i>Imbecille!</i>

1350
01:12:37.524 --> 01:12:39.234
<i>Andiamo!</i> Run, run!

1351
01:12:43.405 --> 01:12:44.406
<i>Finito!</i>

1352
01:12:49.953 --> 01:12:52.456
<i>Per mille cavoli,</i> Guido! Faster!

1353
01:12:52.623 --> 01:12:54.416
Eat, <i>idiota! Più veloce!</i>

1354
01:12:54.499 --> 01:12:55.792
Hey, that's not allowed.

1355
01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:57.044
He's done!

1356
01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:02.716
Done!

1357
01:13:10.265 --> 01:13:11.266
Whoa.

1358
01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:21.693
But he's gotta be here somewhere.

1359
01:13:21.777 --> 01:13:23.362
Thirsty? Water, anyone?

1360
01:13:23.445 --> 01:13:24.613
- Please, don't!
- Not again!

1361
01:13:24.696 --> 01:13:26.448
That's him. That's him!

1362
01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:27.533
Luca, stop!

1363
01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:31.745
Sorry, Mom! Sorry, Dad! I have to do this!

1364
01:13:31.828 --> 01:13:34.831
Get back here right now!

1365
01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:37.292
Wow. He's fast.

1366
01:13:38.794 --> 01:13:40.420
What?

1367
01:13:47.177 --> 01:13:48.637
Oops! <i>Scusa.</i>

1368
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.806
I'll catch you on the... downhill!

1369
01:13:50.889 --> 01:13:53.642
Spewlia, you never even
made it to the downhill.

1370
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:56.520
What?

1371
01:13:58.856 --> 01:14:02.901
<i>Impossibile!</i> He's cheating!
<i>Arbitro! Arbitro!</i>

1372
01:14:03.902 --> 01:14:05.195
Huh?

1373
01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:06.321
No, no, no!

1374
01:14:11.743 --> 01:14:12.744
Ooh.

1375
01:14:21.211 --> 01:14:23.380
Oh, not now! Come on, come on!

1376
01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:25.215
I'm so close!

1377
01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.886
Luca!

1378
01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:32.681
Just stay right there!

1379
01:14:32.764 --> 01:14:33.765
Alberto.

1380
01:14:33.849 --> 01:14:35.184
I'm coming for you!

1381
01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:37.352
What's wrong, <i>piccoletto?</i>

1382
01:14:37.436 --> 01:14:39.104
Afraid of a little rain?

1383
01:14:39.188 --> 01:14:40.189
- Hey!
- Huh?

1384
01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:43.192
For the last time,
you two don't belong here.

1385
01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:45.068
Get out of my town!

1386
01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:53.243
Sea monster! Right there!

1387
01:14:53.327 --> 01:14:54.369
Huh?

1388
01:14:54.453 --> 01:14:55.537
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

1389
01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:57.789
Ciccio! My harpoon! <i>Veloce!</i>

1390
01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:03.962
- Alberto...
- No, stop! Just stay there.

1391
01:15:05.297 --> 01:15:06.423
You're still okay.

1392
01:15:07.049 --> 01:15:09.343
- <i>Andiamo!</i>
- Alberto, wait!

1393
01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:14.056
No!

1394
01:15:32.199 --> 01:15:33.367
What?

1395
01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.953
Whoa! You really are crazy!

1396
01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:37.788
Learned it from you!

1397
01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.373
Let's get to the water!

1398
01:15:40.624 --> 01:15:42.042
No! Ciccio!

1399
01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:43.126
Here it is.

1400
01:15:47.798 --> 01:15:49.424
Hey there.

1401
01:15:49.508 --> 01:15:50.676
Excuse us.

1402
01:15:50.759 --> 01:15:53.220
Out of the way! <i>Via, via!</i>

1403
01:16:03.188 --> 01:16:04.189
Ha-ha!

1404
01:16:07.359 --> 01:16:08.360
Luca!

1405
01:16:12.739 --> 01:16:14.741
Sorry!

1406
01:16:22.374 --> 01:16:23.917
- Oh, no! Luca!
- Son!

1407
01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:28.630
You should've left when I told you.

1408
01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:31.758
Now, I gotta kill some sea monsters!

1409
01:16:33.468 --> 01:16:36.138
So long, evil empire of injustice.

1410
01:16:40.851 --> 01:16:42.644
No!

1411
01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:43.979
Giulia!

1412
01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:52.154
<i>Mostri marini!</i> Give me that!

1413
01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:54.948
Giulia. Are you all right?

1414
01:16:55.032 --> 01:16:57.701
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm okay.

1415
01:16:58.285 --> 01:16:59.786
Thanks, guys.

1416
01:17:00.579 --> 01:17:01.872
Giulietta?

1417
01:17:01.955 --> 01:17:03.123
<i>Papà!</i> I...

1418
01:17:06.293 --> 01:17:08.212
Look at that!

1419
01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:09.588
You're not going anywhere. Come on.

1420
01:17:09.671 --> 01:17:12.508
I saw them first! The reward is mine!

1421
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:14.134
We're not afraid of you!

1422
01:17:14.218 --> 01:17:16.345
No, but we're afraid of you.

1423
01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:19.515
Everyone is horrified
and disgusted by you,

1424
01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:21.475
because you are monsters.

1425
01:17:21.558 --> 01:17:23.185
Stop! They are not monsters.

1426
01:17:23.268 --> 01:17:25.187
Oh, yeah? Who are they, then?

1427
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:26.980
I know who they are.

1428
01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.451
They are Luca and Alberto,

1429
01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:42.037
and...

1430
01:17:42.913 --> 01:17:45.666
they are the winners.

1431
01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:49.461
- Luca!
- Let us through!

1432
01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:50.546
- What?
- Really?

1433
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:52.840
They can't be the winners.
They are not even people!

1434
01:17:52.923 --> 01:17:54.258
<i>Signora</i> Marsigliese?

1435
01:17:55.926 --> 01:17:58.512
Technically, legally,

1436
01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:00.055
yes, they won.

1437
01:18:00.138 --> 01:18:01.682
We won?

1438
01:18:01.765 --> 01:18:03.892
Who cares if they won?
They are sea monsters.

1439
01:18:09.439 --> 01:18:11.567
- <i>Andiamo.</i>
- Hmm.

1440
01:18:14.778 --> 01:18:15.779
What? Come on!

1441
01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:16.864
- Hey!
- Ha!

1442
01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:18.657
Ciccio! Guido! Another harpoon.

1443
01:18:19.449 --> 01:18:23.203
Ah, <i>idioti!</i> Be useful for once
in your pathetic lives.

1444
01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:25.455
- Guido.
- Ciccio.

1445
01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:31.628
Oops.

1446
01:18:31.712 --> 01:18:33.964
No, <i>piccolino.</i>

1447
01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:36.300
It's over, the reign of terror.

1448
01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:37.843
It's finally over!

1449
01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:39.344
- Luca!
- Luca!

1450
01:18:40.846 --> 01:18:42.973
You had us worried half to death,
and you must never do that again!

1451
01:18:43.056 --> 01:18:44.057
I'm sorry.

1452
01:18:44.141 --> 01:18:47.060
And you raced your little tail off
and kicked so much human butt!

1453
01:18:47.144 --> 01:18:50.189
And I'm so proud of you,
and I am so mad at you!

1454
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.816
I love you, Mom.

1455
01:18:52.983 --> 01:18:53.984
Son.

1456
01:18:58.363 --> 01:19:00.115
<i>Signore e signori,</i>

1457
01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:03.577
the winners of this year's Portorosso Cup,

1458
01:19:04.036 --> 01:19:05.329
the underdogs.

1459
01:19:05.412 --> 01:19:07.581
Wow.

1460
01:19:07.706 --> 01:19:09.416
- Wow.
- Yeah!

1461
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.335
- I can't believe we won!
- We won!

1462
01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:12.794
Yes! Underdogs!

1463
01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:14.546
Ugh.

1464
01:19:20.594 --> 01:19:22.137
- Give me that!
- Here.

1465
01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:29.978
We did it!

1466
01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:32.272
They won!

1467
01:19:35.776 --> 01:19:38.070
Feast your eyes on the greatest Vespa

1468
01:19:38.153 --> 01:19:39.780
the world has ever seen!

1469
01:19:42.241 --> 01:19:43.784
Perfect.

1470
01:19:48.997 --> 01:19:50.040
Mmm.

1471
01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:52.543
- <i>Signora.</i>
- <i>Grazie.</i>

1472
01:19:52.626 --> 01:19:54.127
Mom! What are you doing here?

1473
01:19:54.211 --> 01:19:56.213
I come to town most weekends.

1474
01:19:57.422 --> 01:19:58.715
You're not gonna catch me!

1475
01:19:58.799 --> 01:20:00.509
- Underdogs forever!
- Whoo-hoo!

1476
01:20:00.592 --> 01:20:05.430
What he did today was amazing.

1477
01:20:05.514 --> 01:20:08.016
But we can't let him stay in this world.

1478
01:20:08.684 --> 01:20:09.685
Can we?

1479
01:20:09.768 --> 01:20:12.437
Some people, they'll never accept him.

1480
01:20:13.605 --> 01:20:15.315
But some will.

1481
01:20:15.399 --> 01:20:18.610
And he seems to know
how to find the good ones.

1482
01:20:22.072 --> 01:20:23.657
So, where will you go first?

1483
01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.576
We're gonna stick around here for a bit.

1484
01:20:25.659 --> 01:20:28.620
We gotta fix this thing up
before we take it across the entire Earth.

1485
01:20:28.704 --> 01:20:31.206
Okay. Just don't forget to pack.

1486
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:34.710
<i>Santo Gorgonzola!</i>
I need to pack! For school!

1487
01:20:34.793 --> 01:20:38.839
Oh, yeah, school.
You're gonna learn so much.

1488
01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:41.258
Um, I can leave you some books.

1489
01:20:41.341 --> 01:20:42.551
You can?

1490
01:20:42.843 --> 01:20:44.469
Come on, Alberto!

1491
01:20:56.523 --> 01:20:58.358
And you have your lunch for the train?

1492
01:20:58.442 --> 01:21:00.736
- <i>Sì.</i>
- Sweater? If it gets cold?

1493
01:21:00.819 --> 01:21:03.238
For the millionth time, <i>sì.</i>

1494
01:21:03.322 --> 01:21:05.365
I love you, too, <i>Papà.</i>

1495
01:21:07.409 --> 01:21:09.995
<i>Santa mozzarella,</i> we did it.

1496
01:21:10.078 --> 01:21:12.414
Well, Giulia,
can't wait to race next summer.

1497
01:21:12.497 --> 01:21:14.583
Or we could just have fun.

1498
01:21:16.418 --> 01:21:17.711
<i>Ciao,</i> Giulia.

1499
01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.807
Well, let's go fix up our Vespa.

1500
01:21:30.891 --> 01:21:32.726
Yeah, about that. Uh...

1501
01:21:32.809 --> 01:21:35.312
It's a crazy thing. I might have sold it.

1502
01:21:38.815 --> 01:21:39.816
Luca?

1503
01:21:40.067 --> 01:21:42.653
Mom? What are you all doing here?

1504
01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:48.200
If you promise to write to us
every single day

1505
01:21:48.283 --> 01:21:51.495
and be as safe as possible,
and I mean safer than safe,

1506
01:21:52.246 --> 01:21:55.123
you can go to school.

1507
01:21:55.582 --> 01:21:56.834
I can?

1508
01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.502
It's all arranged, actually.

1509
01:21:58.585 --> 01:22:00.587
You'd stay with Giulia and her mom.

1510
01:22:00.671 --> 01:22:02.548
Your friend talked them into it.

1511
01:22:02.631 --> 01:22:03.924
It wasn't easy.

1512
01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:07.761
Luca, do you promise?

1513
01:22:07.845 --> 01:22:09.555
Yes! Yes, I promise!

1514
01:22:10.305 --> 01:22:11.515
Thank you.

1515
01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.687
Oh. Just remember,
we are always here for you.

1516
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:17.771
Okay?

1517
01:22:18.605 --> 01:22:20.732
Hey. Look me in the eye.

1518
01:22:21.608 --> 01:22:23.485
You know I love you, right?

1519
01:22:23.569 --> 01:22:25.571
I know.

1520
01:22:31.076 --> 01:22:33.120
Come on, Alberto. The train's gonna leave.

1521
01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:36.832
Where's your stuff?

1522
01:22:37.624 --> 01:22:39.710
Yeah, well, you see...

1523
01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:41.295
You are coming, right?

1524
01:22:41.712 --> 01:22:46.008
Um, I would, but Massimo asked
if I wanted to stick around.

1525
01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:48.927
Move in maybe. And I just thought, uh...

1526
01:22:50.179 --> 01:22:52.806
I think he needs me.
You know?

1527
01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:56.852
I can't do it without you.

1528
01:22:56.935 --> 01:22:58.437
But you're never without me.

1529
01:23:01.064 --> 01:23:02.983
The next time that you jump off a cliff

1530
01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:05.736
or tell Bruno to quit bothering you,

1531
01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:07.362
that's me.

1532
01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:11.366
But how am I gonna know you're okay?

1533
01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:21.126
You got me off the island, Luca.

1534
01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:24.505
I'm okay.

1535
01:23:33.555 --> 01:23:36.808
Seriously,
what does that mean?

1536
01:23:36.975 --> 01:23:39.520
No idea. Go find out for me, will ya?

1537
01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:51.657
Go, Luca!

1538
01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.325
Go!

1539
01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:56.370
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1540
01:33:47.419 --> 01:33:50.297
Some people think
I'm mad to live in the deep.

1541
01:33:50.714 --> 01:33:53.425
I think that they are the ones
who are mad,

1542
01:33:53.509 --> 01:33:56.136
not me the one who is mad, it's them.

1543
01:33:56.303 --> 01:33:58.388
It's a nice life, simple life.

1544
01:33:58.555 --> 01:34:00.474
It's away from the hustle and bustle,

1545
01:34:00.557 --> 01:34:02.184
all the stuff that you don't want.

1546
01:34:04.811 --> 01:34:07.064
Mmm. Whale carcass.

1547
01:34:07.814 --> 01:34:09.274
Anyway, you're gonna have fun.

1548
01:34:09.566 --> 01:34:12.986
You'll get to hear me talk.
I can talk without stopping,

1549
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:16.240
sometimes for maybe 12 hours.

1550
01:34:16.615 --> 01:34:19.034
And you get to listen, so you're lucky.

1551
01:34:20.577 --> 01:34:22.079
Well done.
